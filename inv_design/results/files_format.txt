In this folder, the files will be in form of dictionnary. The content of the dictionnary varies from whether the arrays contained in the files are of 2 dimensions (one value of N), or are of 3 dimensions (many different values of N). In the former case, the dictionnary will contain the size of the matrix, starting frequency, ending frequency, initial pump amplitude, pump group velocity, length of waveguide, value of N, optimized parameters (will depend on whether we restrain the pump to be Gaussian or not) and the initial parameters seed values.
