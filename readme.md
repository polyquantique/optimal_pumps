This repo is used to find the optimal parameters of the pump laser to get high purity quantum light by SPDC process. This project is based on Jax.
To use Jax, Jaxlib as well as Jax need to be downloaded. A way to download Jax for windows is to use the [unstable build](https://github.com/cloudhan/jax-windows-builder). For Linux and MacOS users, please refer to installation section [here](https://github.com/google/jax).
